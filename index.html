    <h1>About me.</h1>
    <br>
    Hello, My name is Maria Morales, or Mary for short. Born in the beautiful and awkward era of the 90s. 
    I currently live in Miami, FL. I grew up in Nicaragua, so I am fluet in both English and Spanish.
    I enjoy design and love learning how things work. On my free time, I like
    to enjoy the beach, candle making, using clay to create different things, and relaxing at home with my 12 year 
    old pup and college sweetheart. I enjoy meeting new people, and nothing brings me greater joy than a job well done!
    I believe communication and constructive critisim is crucial to create some breath taking and functional websites.
